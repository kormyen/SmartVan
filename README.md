## History
- 12018-07-05 : PDU main and office light control activated.
- 12018-07-08 : PDU bedroom and kitchen ceiling fan control activated.

## Why
I wanted this initially for 7 dimmable light sets and 2 speed adjustable fans controlled by two switch panels each with only one dimmer module rather than a individual dimmer for every light set and fan per switch panel. Doing it in software seemed more potentially expandable at a later date and most importantly simpler for me than hardware 'flip-flop' stuff and other more complex wiring.
