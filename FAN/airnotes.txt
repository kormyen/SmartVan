AIR CHANGES
  3-5 air chages per hour recommended

  Van cargo space is:  3.2m x 1.8m x 1.8m = 10.3m3
  3x  =  30 m3/h
  5x  =  50 m3/5
  10x = 100 m3/h 

  Average 120mm PC fan = 20-40~ CFM
  20 CFM = 34 m3/h
  40 CFM = 68 m3/h



OPTIONS FOR CONTROLLING FAN SPEED
  0 - Arduino PWM out to alter fan duty cycle
    - terrible as low speed creates high pitch noise from fans

  1 - Arduino controlled logic-level digital-pot 
    - don't have one currently

  2 - programmable voltage regulator                
    - looks complex?

  3 - use four pin fan, one pin is for PWN-in for controlling speed 
    - seems like best option, but I don't have one currently

  4 - Use relay to switch between two power supplys (5v low speed and 12v high speed)
    - seems a bit sketchy but... should work

  PROBABLY IDEAL OPTION   : 3 or 1
  VIABLE OPTION CURRENTLY : 4
